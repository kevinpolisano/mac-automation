## Shortcuts on Mac and iOS

### YouTube Playlist from a Google Sheet

- Suppose you have a list of YouTube URL stored in a Google Sheet. 
- The goal of this Shortcut is to generate a temporary YouTube playlist from the (last) items of that list.
- Open with Safari the icloud link to this Shortcut: [YouTube Playlist from a Google Sheet (template)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c91376ea9a3c4005bc053e4c6051d6b3)
- **Example**: I'm using *Feedly* to organize my Youtube channels by topics. Concerning music channels, whose content is captured in a topic 'Music', I would like to select some of the new videos from it and create a corresponding temporary playlist on Youtube for listening them without interruption. To do that first I create a *Feedly* 'board' called 'Music' where my selection goes, and a *Zapier* or *IFTTT* applet which automatically fills my Google Sheet with each new Youtube link I want to listen later. When I'm ready for listening, I press the Shortcut button on my iphone and it generate immediately a playlist of the 10 (or more) last songs I'd like to discover.
